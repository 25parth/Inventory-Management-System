Inventory Management System – Detailed Project Description

The Inventory Management System is a Java-based console application developed to manage and monitor inventory operations efficiently for small businesses or organizations. The primary goal of the system is to provide a reliable and structured solution for handling product records, tracking stock levels, and reducing errors associated with manual inventory management.

The system allows users to perform essential inventory operations such as adding new products, updating existing product details, deleting products, and viewing the complete list of available items. Each product is uniquely identified using a product ID and stores key attributes including product name, price, and available quantity. This ensures accurate identification and management of inventory items.

In addition to basic CRUD operations, the application supports stock issue and restock functionalities. When products are issued or restocked, the system automatically updates inventory quantities in real time, maintaining data consistency. A low-stock alert mechanism is incorporated to notify users when the quantity of a product falls below a predefined threshold, helping prevent stock shortages and improve inventory planning.

The project is implemented using Core Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and separation of concerns. Inventory data is managed efficiently using the Java Collections Framework, particularly HashMap, which provides fast product lookup and improves overall system performance. Custom exception handling is used to enforce business rules and handle invalid operations, while comprehensive input validation ensures the integrity and reliability of data entered into the system.

The application follows a menu-driven design, making it simple and user-friendly even for non-technical users. It is packaged as an executable JAR file, allowing easy deployment and execution on any system with a Java Runtime Environment. The system is designed to be extensible, with future enhancements such as file-based persistence, database integration using JDBC, or a graphical user interface possible.

Overall, the Inventory Management System serves as a practical college-level project that demonstrates strong Java fundamentals, clean code design, and real-world problem-solving skills.
